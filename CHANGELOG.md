## 3.5.0 (2026-04-09)

### Implement skill — chain-of-custody decomposition into 4 step files (OpenCode + weaker-models compatibility)

Third application of the chain-of-custody pattern validated in 3.3.0 (brainstorm) and 3.4.0 (plan). The implement skill was the largest in the repo at 401 lines with four distributed `<HARD-GATE-*>` blocks — the highest-risk skill for silent gate-skipping on weaker models.

- feat(implement): `SKILL.md` rewritten as a ~140-line bootstrap containing the top-level `<HARD-GATE>` block (pipeline enforcement + bundling prohibition + two-review-layers rationale), the Instruction Priority and Subagent Rules references, the Prerequisite, the workflow diagram with the 4 step file paths, the execution rules (including the "Step 2 is a per-task LOOP" reminder), and the global "Red Flags — you are about to break the pipeline" anti-pattern table (8 rows). No step content remains in `SKILL.md`.
- feat(implement): 4 new step files under `skills/implement/`:
  - `step-01-load-plan.md` — loads the plan, verifies task decomposition, registers plan tasks via `TaskCreate`.
  - `step-02-execute-tasks.md` — **the per-task LOOP**. Contains all 6 sub-steps (2a Dispatch Implementer, 2b Validation Gate, 2c Conformity Check, 2d Per-task Quality Review with `<HARD-GATE-PER-TASK-REVIEW>`, 2e Discovery Check, 2f Task Completion Record) inline as `##`-level headings, plus the inlined Failure Handling sub-section. The End of Step 2 block explicitly instructs the model to stay in this file and iterate through ALL plan tasks before handing off to Step 3.
  - `step-03-final-review.md` — renumbered from the original Step 4. Contains Pre-review Audit, `<HARD-GATE-CODE-QUALITY>`-wrapped Code Quality sub-section, Security Triage (14 triggers), Dispatch Reviews (code-reviewer + optional security-reviewer in parallel), and Handle Review Results.
  - `step-04-completion.md` — renumbered from the original Step 5. Contains `<HARD-GATE-FINAL-VALIDATION>`, the `## Final Validation Checklist` block, `TaskList` verification, completion summary, Learnings capture, spec status update to `Implemented`, and the "what next?" user prompt.
- feat(implement): the original `Step 3: Failure Handling` (~15 lines) has been **inlined into `step-02-execute-tasks.md`** as a `## Failure Handling` sub-section at the end of the per-task pipeline. It is not a sequential step — it is a sub-procedure that kicks in during Step 2b when a task fails validation. Inlining is semantically cleaner than a trivial orphan file.
- feat(implement): every step file ends with a mandatory `## ✅ End of Step N` block containing (a) a step-specific completion checklist and (b) an explicit hand-off pointing to the next file. Step 2's End block is the LOOP gate — it explicitly instructs the model to return to the top of the file while plan tasks remain, and only hand off to Step 3 when all plan tasks have been processed.
- refactor(implement): internal "Step 4" and "Step 5" references renumbered consistently to "Step 3" and "Step 4" to match the new 4-step numbering. Affected locations: top-level `<HARD-GATE>` block ("Final review (Step 4)" → "(Step 3)"), Step 2a DONE_WITH_CONCERNS handling ("final completion summary (Step 5)" → "Step 4"), Step 2d rationale ("which happens in Step 4 on the full diff" → "Step 3", "Final review (Step 4) is the expensive one" → "Step 3", "security-reviewer in Step 4 handles that" → "Step 3"), Step 2f Task Completion Record ("feeds the final validation in Step 5" → "Step 4"), `<HARD-GATE-CODE-QUALITY>` block (4 "Step 4" → "Step 3" references), Step 4 completion summary bullet ("the final review (Step 4)" → "Step 3"). All are mechanical 1-character-word updates.
- No new task tracking added: `/ops-implement` already uses `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList` for **plan-task** tracking (registered in Step 1, updated during Step 2, verified in Step 4). Adding step-level tasks would duplicate this and clutter the user-visible task list. Step files' `## ✅ End of Step N` blocks therefore do NOT include `TaskUpdate` for step-level progress — they rely on the existing plan-task tracking for progress visibility. This is an intentional deviation from the brainstorm/plan decomposition pattern, justified by implement's pre-existing task tracking.
- No content loss: all four `<HARD-GATE-*>` blocks preserved verbatim content-wise (with only the mechanical "Step 4" → "Step 3" reference updates noted above); the 2a Model Selection table, the 2b validation command table, the per-task dispatch prompt (including the 5 placeholder variants for non-text content), the repeated-finding circuit breaker rule, the Task Completion Record template, the Failure Handling procedure, the Pre-review Audit block template, the Security Triage block template, the code-reviewer and security-reviewer dispatch instructions, the Final Validation Checklist template, and the Learnings capture template are all intact.
- No behavior change: the per-task pipeline (2a → 2f), the two review layers (per-task lightweight + final full-diff), the four HARD gates, the required output blocks, the 3-fail retry + circuit breaker, the `TaskList` verification, and the downstream `/ops-ship` expectation all behave identically to v3.4.0. Only the file layout and the "Step N" numbering (Step 4→3, Step 5→4, old Step 3 inlined into Step 2) changed.

## 3.4.0 (2026-04-09)

### Plan skill — chain-of-custody decomposition into 10 step files (OpenCode + weaker-models compatibility)

Second application of the chain-of-custody pattern validated in 3.3.0 on the brainstorm skill. The plan skill has been decomposed into 10 sequential step files numbered 00-09 (matching the existing Step 0 to Step 9 sequence). Motivation is identical: the skill runs on non-Claude models via OpenCode whose instruction-following is weaker than Claude's family, and the monolithic 426-line `SKILL.md` was exceeding their effective attention budget. Plan was the most urgent next target because it is the longest ops skill and has four distributed HARD gates that weaker models were silently skipping.

- feat(plan): `SKILL.md` rewritten as a ~130-line bootstrap containing the two top-level hard gates (`HARD-GATE-0`, `HARD-GATE-1`), the "When to use which skill" decision table, the Instruction Priority and Subagent Rules references, the Overview, the workflow diagram with all 10 file paths, the execution rules (including the branching-hand-off rule for Steps 4 and 8), and the global "Red Flags — you are about to skip a step" anti-pattern table. No step content remains in `SKILL.md`.
- feat(plan): 10 new step files under `skills/plan/`:
  - `step-00-discover-commands.md` — creates the 10-task progress checklist as a preamble, then discovers project test/build/lint commands. Environment health check with `/ops-init` proposal preserved. Contains a reminder of HARD-GATE-0 and HARD-GATE-1 from the bootstrap.
  - `step-01-clarify-intent.md` — clarity check + scope check + brainstorm offer, with the "brainstorm already done" branch preserved. Requires the `## Intent Confirmed` output block regardless of which branch.
  - `step-02-context-detection.md` — project instruction file + directory structure + conventions.
  - `step-03-parallel-research.md` — `HARD-GATE-RESEARCH` collocated with the 3-agent dispatch instruction (researcher-code + researcher-doc + git-historian, single message).
  - `step-04-research-adequacy.md` — evidence table with 4 dimensions, **branching hand-off with 3 branches**: Branch A (3-4 OK → Step 5), Branch B (1-2 GAP → stay in step, fill the gap, re-evaluate), Branch C (0 evidence → go back to Step 1).
  - `step-05-design-approaches.md` — 2-3 approaches with name/how/pros/cons/fits/reuse + mandatory External Dependency Validation block + approach gate.
  - `step-06-write-review-spec.md` — sub-steps 6a/6b/6c/6d kept in a single file (tightly coupled: present by sections → write file → spec-reviewer loop → present to user). The inner spec-review loop is handled inside the step, not at the hand-off level.
  - `step-07-write-plan.md` — task decomposition mandatory rules + no-placeholders list + project-instruction-driven tasks + sizing guide + TDD granularity.
  - `step-08-critic-review.md` — required dispatch context (plan path, spec path, brainstorm summary verbatim, project instruction file), Lens 5 brainstorm trace rationale, degraded case, `## Critic Re-verification` block template, **branching hand-off with 2 branches**: Branch A (APPROVE → Step 9), Branch B (REJECT → stay, re-dispatch via `ops-redispatch-optimization`, max 3 iterations, re-evaluate).
  - `step-09-user-approval.md` — `HARD-GATE-HANDOFF` collocated with the 3-option user prompt. Explicitly forbids implementing code inline.
- feat(plan): every step file ends with a mandatory `## ✅ End of Step N` block containing (a) a step-specific completion checklist, (b) a `TaskUpdate` instruction to mark the step completed, and (c) an explicit hand-off. Steps 4 and 8 have branching hand-offs that explicitly describe each branch and the corresponding next file or loop-back behavior.
- feat(plan): task tracking added to `/ops-plan` (previously absent) — Step 0's preamble creates a 10-task checklist matching the 10 steps; each step file marks its own task `in_progress` at the start and `completed` at the end via `TaskUpdate`. This mirrors the pattern established in `/ops-brainstorm` 3.3.0. Task names: "Plan: discover commands", "Plan: clarify intent", "Plan: context detection", "Plan: parallel research", "Plan: research adequacy check", "Plan: design approaches", "Plan: write & review spec", "Plan: write plan", "Plan: critic review", "Plan: user approval".
- No content loss: all four `<HARD-GATE-*>` blocks preserved verbatim (`HARD-GATE-0` and `HARD-GATE-1` in `SKILL.md` bootstrap, `HARD-GATE-RESEARCH` in `step-03`, `HARD-GATE-HANDOFF` in `step-09`); the "When to use which skill" table, the research adequacy dimensions table, the external-dependency validation template, the 5-section plan structure, the task decomposition rules, the no-placeholders list, the critic dispatch requirements, the `Critic Re-verification` block template, and the Red Flags table are all intact.
- Minor behavior change: task tracking was not previously part of `/ops-plan` — this is the only behavior change, documented explicitly above. The 10-step workflow, the 4 HARD gates, the required output blocks (`Discovered Commands`, `Intent Confirmed`, research adequacy table, `Critic Re-verification`), the re-dispatch loops, and the downstream `/ops-implement` handoff all behave identically to v3.3.0.

## 3.3.0 (2026-04-08)

### Brainstorm skill — chain-of-custody decomposition into 11 step files (OpenCode + weaker-models compatibility)

The brainstorm skill has been decomposed into 11 sequential step files using a chain-of-custody loading pattern. Motivation: the skill runs on non-Claude models via OpenCode (GPT-4o-mini, Mistral, Gemini Flash, local models) whose instruction-following is measurably weaker than the Claude family. A monolithic 345-line `SKILL.md` was exceeding the effective attention budget of these models — they would silently skip gates and dimensions. The chain-of-custody pattern reduces per-turn instruction load to a single 30-to-180-line step file, and an explicit hand-off at the end of each file removes the model's discretion over when to read the next step.

- feat(brainstorm): `SKILL.md` rewritten as a ~60-line bootstrap containing only purpose, workflow diagram with the 11 file paths, global constraints, execution rules, and the instruction to read `step-01-task-checklist.md` to begin. No step content remains in `SKILL.md`.
- feat(brainstorm): 11 new step files under `skills/brainstorm/`:
  - `step-01-task-checklist.md` — creates the 10-task progress checklist
  - `step-02-clarity-check.md` — restate-what-why-success gate
  - `step-03-explore-context.md` — project state / recent commits / conventions
  - `step-04-visual-companion.md` — mockups/diagrams companion offer
  - `step-05-assess-scope.md` — multi-subsystem decomposition check
  - `step-06-clarifying-questions.md` — intent/context A/B/C questions (one at a time)
  - `step-07-architectural-decisions.md` — HARD-GATE-FORK + 7-dimensions checklist with inline templates (the densest file, ~180 lines)
  - `step-08-design-sections.md` — section-by-section design validation
  - `step-09-yagni-filter.md` — YAGNI Check block
  - `step-10-summary.md` — Brainstorm Summary template with architectural-decisions block
  - `step-11-transition.md` — `/ops-plan` hand-off
- feat(brainstorm): every step file ends with a mandatory `## ✅ End of Step N` block containing (a) a step-specific completion checklist, (b) a `TaskUpdate` instruction to mark the step completed, and (c) an explicit hand-off: `**→ Next: read skills/brainstorm/step-NN+1-[name].md now and execute Step N+1.** Do NOT continue without reading that file first.` This is the chain-of-custody enforcement mechanism — the model does not decide when to load the next file, the current file tells it.
- feat(brainstorm): Step 1 task list expanded from 9 to 10 tasks — `summary & transition` split into `Brainstorm: summary` (Step 10) and `Brainstorm: transition` (Step 11) for atomic per-step progress tracking.
- No content loss: every instruction, template, gate, example, and constraint from the previous monolithic `SKILL.md` has been preserved verbatim and relocated into the appropriate step file. The `<HARD-GATE-FORK>` block (Step 7), the 7-dimension architectural checklist with its 3 inline templates, the Step 10 summary template with numbered dimensions, and the 5 global constraints are all intact.
- No behavior change in the brainstorm workflow: the 11 steps, the gates, the forced choices, and the downstream critic Lens 5 brainstorm trace consumption all behave identically. Only the file layout and per-turn attention load changed.

## 3.2.1 (2026-04-08)

### Brainstorm skill — Step 6/7 consolidation (structural refactor, no behavior change)

Resolved a dual source-of-truth problem in `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`: question templates for three architectural dimensions (instance defaults, authorization source, failure mode) lived in Step 6 while the checklist of seven dimensions they belong to lived in Step 7, forcing a meta-paragraph in Step 6 to explain the cross-reference. Symptom: weaker models lost track of which dimensions were templated and which were not, and the "applies if" conditions were duplicated in both steps.

- refactor(brainstorm): Step 6 reduced to intent/context clarification only (~15 lines). Templates A/B/C removed from Step 6; the meta-paragraph "Structure of this section" removed. A new "Scope of this step" note explicitly forbids anticipating Step 7's architectural questions in Step 6.
- refactor(brainstorm): Step 7 "Architectural Dimensions Checklist" restructured from a flat table into an overview table + seven numbered `#### Dimension N` sub-sections. The three templated dimensions (2 Source of truth for permissions, 3 Instance-wide defaults, 4 Failure mode) now contain their A/B/C(/D) templates inline, verbatim, collocated with the dimension they serve. The four non-templated dimensions keep their short question format.
- refactor(brainstorm): Step 10 Summary template renamed dimension headings from free-form ("Source of truth for permissions") to numbered ("Dimension 2 — Source of truth for permissions") to align with Step 7's numbering. Example text updated to reference "answer to Dimension N template" instead of "Template A/B/C answer".
- No behavior change: the HARD-GATE-FORK, the mandatory checklist, the forced choice rules, and the downstream critic Lens 5 brainstorm trace consumption all remain identical. Only the location and naming of content changed.

## 3.2.0 (2026-04-07)

### Architectural decision-locking and per-task quality review (inspired by superpowers analysis)

Improvements addressing a class of failure where `/ops-plan` produces an internally coherent plan whose architecture is measurably inferior to alternatives that were never considered. Root cause: the brainstorm phase deferred architectural decisions to research, and the research phase optimized for shortest implementation path rather than cleanest design. The fix has two pillars expressed across the entries below: (1) lock architectural decisions during brainstorm via mandatory question templates and a HARD-GATE-FORK, and (2) add an early-warning quality gate during implementation via a per-task code-reviewer dispatch with Lens-5-style drift detection.

- feat(brainstorm): `<HARD-GATE-FORK>` in Step 7 forbids deferring architectural decisions to `/ops-plan` or research. Phrases like "we'll figure this out during the plan", "TBD", or any equivalent deferral trigger a skill failure.
- feat(brainstorm): mandatory question Template A "Deployment-instance defaults" — A/B/C/D format covering env-var/setting overrides for instance operators. Applies to any feature with a toggle/policy.
- feat(brainstorm): mandatory question Template B "Source of truth for authorization" — A/B/C format forcing explicit choice between server-driven ability, client-driven reconciliation, or hybrid. Applies to any permission/visibility feature.
- feat(brainstorm): mandatory question Template C "Failure mode" — A/B/C format forcing explicit fail-closed/fail-open/retry choice. Applies to any feature with async or external dependencies.
- feat(brainstorm): Step 7 "Architectural Dimensions Checklist" with 7 dimensions (storage, authority placement, instance defaults, failure mode, UI placement, backward compatibility, test boundaries). Each applicable dimension must have an explicit user choice before moving to Step 8.
- feat(brainstorm): Step 10 Summary template now requires a structured `### Architectural decisions (per dimension)` section listing each Step 7 dimension with its chosen value. This is the data the critic's Lens 5 brainstorm trace check consumes.
- feat(brainstorm): Step 11 Transition explicitly requires keeping the Brainstorm Summary block visible in conversation context so `/ops-plan` Step 8 can attach it to the critic dispatch.
- feat(critic): new **Lens 5 — Architectural Alternatives** with 7 checks (single source of truth, authority placement, coupling, fragility, why-not-extract, instance defaults, brainstorm trace). Severity rules: REJECT if a meaningfully cleaner alternative exists, or if documented fragility affects security/permissions. Phase 6 verdict updated.
- feat(critic): new **4th perspective "Architect"** in Phase 3 multi-perspective review. Drives Lens 5. Surfaces design quality issues that the Executor / Stakeholder / Skeptic perspectives miss.
- feat(critic): new red flags row entries: "extends existing code = right pattern" → SHORTEST path, not CLEANEST; "fragility documented = OK" → documentation is not justification; "alternatives explored = no need to challenge" → if alternatives were explored, they should appear in the brainstorm summary.
- feat(plan): Step 8 critic dispatch now mandates a structured context block — plan path, spec path, **brainstorm summary verbatim** (required for Lens 5 brainstorm trace check), project instruction file. Degraded-case clause for direct `/ops-plan` invocation without prior brainstorm.
- feat(implement): new **Step 2d — Per-task Quality Review** between conformity check and discovery check. Lightweight code-reviewer dispatch on the cumulative working tree state captured by the new `scripts/ops-capture-task-state.sh` script (tracked diff via `git diff HEAD` plus untracked new file contents via `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`), with the dispatch prompt scoping findings to the task being reviewed. Catches duplication and Lens-5-style architectural drift task by task while context is hot. Fix loop max 3 iterations with repeated-finding circuit breaker. Inspired by superpowers' subagent-driven-development pattern, adapted to ops's "no commit per task" convention.
- feat(scripts): new `scripts/ops-capture-task-state.sh` — read-only script that captures the cumulative working tree state for the per-task quality review (tracked changes via `git diff HEAD` + untracked new files via `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`, with binary detection). Used by `/ops-implement` Step 2d. Tested empirically against clean trees, modified-only tasks, new-file-only tasks, mixed scenarios, binary files, and a real repo with 4273 lines of state. Per AGENTS.md convention: deterministic logic in `scripts/`, not inlined in skills.
- feat(implement): two-layer review architecture documented in HARD-GATE — per-task lightweight (Step 2d) catches single-task drift; final full-diff review (Step 4) catches cross-task issues. Both mandatory.
- feat(implement): `<HARD-GATE-CODE-QUALITY>` scoped to Step 4 final review only. The per-task review at Step 2d is exempt to keep iteration cheap. qlty/lint hygiene at the per-task level is delegated to commit hooks or to the final code-quality pass.
- feat(implement): per-task quality review entry in Task Completion Record (Step 2f) with iteration count and suggestions list.
- feat(implement): three new red flags row entries: "skip per-task, final will catch it", "fix per-task issues in final pass", "task 1 was clean so skip task 2".
- feat(researcher-code): new top-of-file mission statement — "**You report observations, not recommendations.**" Reframes the agent as observer rather than architect. Patterns are observations. Architectural decisions belong to the brainstorm phase and the planner.
- feat(researcher-code): explicit forbidden phrasing list — "recommended", "the right approach", "natural fit", "naturally extend", "we should", "the plan should". Required phrasing examples for neutral observation framing.
- feat(researcher-code): new output markers `[FRAGILITY]` for fire-and-forget / fail-open / missing tests on critical paths, `[POTENTIAL EXTENSION POINT]` for existing mechanisms the task could mechanically extend (decision deferred to planner).
- feat(researcher-code): Output Format updated — "Files in scope (observation, not prescription)" replaces "Files to Create/Modify"; "Currently interacts with" replaces "Will interact with"; "(observations only)" appended to Similar Implementations heading.
- fix(implement): line 123 referenced "completion summary (Step 4)" but the completion summary is in Step 5. Corrected to reference task completion record (Step 2f) and final completion summary (Step 5).
- fix(implement): renumbered sub-steps 2d→2e (Discovery Check) and 2e→2f (Task Completion Record) to make room for the new 2d (Per-task Quality Review). All cross-references updated.
- fix(full): Step 3 pipeline description updated to include the per-task quality review and completion record.
- fix(README + CHANGELOG): "4 lenses" → "5 lenses incl. architectural alternatives", "3 perspectives" → "4 perspectives incl. Architect".

## 3.1.1 (2026-04-02)

### Review skill — anti-sycophancy and source-aware feedback handling

- feat: add anti-sycophancy section to `ops-review` — forbidden responses table (performative agreement, gratitude expressions), correct response examples (technical acknowledgment only), self-test: "technical content or social noise?"
- feat: source-specific feedback handling — user feedback (trusted, skip to action) vs. external reviewers (verify technically first, 4-point checklist with YAGNI grep check)
- feat: strengthened ambiguity handling — STOP and clarify ALL unclear items before implementing, multi-item ordering: blocking → simple → complex, test each individually
- fix: consistency cleanup — "just say thanks" → "acknowledge and proceed", deduplicated Prohibited Behaviors table against new anti-sycophancy section
- inspired by superpowers plugin `receiving-code-review` skill, adapted to ops conventions

## 3.1.0 (2026-04-02)

- feat: OpenCode support via `.opencode/plugins/ops.js` (plugin ESM) with dynamic slash command registration
- feat: `package.json` added for OpenCode git-based plugin installation
- feat: `AGENTS.md` as primary project instructions (OpenCode native), `CLAUDE.md` now points to it via `@AGENTS.md`
- refactor: CLI-agnostic project instruction references — all skills and agents now reference `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `GEMINI.md` (whichever exists) instead of hardcoded `CLAUDE.md`
- feat: `data/bootstrap-context.md` — shared skill routing table read by both Claude Code and OpenCode adapters
- feat: `.opencode/INSTALL.md` with installation instructions

- refactor: `ops-plan` Step 0 no longer runs full `ops-init` — limited to project command discovery (build/test/lint), with environment health check that proposes `/ops-init` if issues detected
- refactor: `ops-init` simplified to single mode (user-invoked only), removed dual plan/user-invoked mode
- fix: clarify project instruction file locations as "at the project root" in `instruction-priority`, `review-pr`, `security`, and `review-pipeline` — prevents agents from searching user-level directories
- feat: `/ops-audit` — full codebase audit (qlty + semgrep), unified report with cross-triage and severity classification
- feat: duplication checks in `ops-plan` Step 5 (Reuse criterion) and critic Lens 1
- fix: remove dead semgrep baseline scan from `ops-init` (`.semgrep/baseline.json` was generated but never consumed)

- feat: language rule in `ops-instruction-priority` — respond in the user's language
- feat: spec status lifecycle (`Draft` → `Approved` → `Implemented`) across `ops-plan` and `ops-implement`

- feat: English-only rule in `AGENTS.md` for the ops repository

## 2.3.4 (2026-03-30)

### Reasoning effort baselines for all agents

- feat: added `effort` frontmatter to all 11 agent definitions — opus agents default to `high`, sonnet agents (researcher-doc, git-historian) default to `medium`
- feat: added effort baseline rule to `ops:subagent-rules` — respect agent defaults, prefer lowering for mechanical subtasks
- docs: README agents table now includes Model and Effort columns

## 2.3.3 (2026-03-30)

### ops:plan — Lightweight intent clarification replaces built-in brainstorm

- refactor: replaced Step 1 full brainstorm process (~120 lines, 9 sub-steps) with lightweight intent clarification (~40 lines, 3 sub-steps: clarity check, scope check, offer `/ops:brainstorm`)
- removed: embedded brainstorm checklist, visual companion offer, YAGNI filter, design-by-sections, approach proposals — all now exclusive to `/ops:brainstorm`
- added: explicit suggestion to invoke `/ops:brainstorm` when the problem space is ambiguous
- renamed: gate block from "Brainstorm Complete" to "Intent Confirmed"
- updated: all internal references (workflow summary, hard gates, overview, research scoping) from "brainstorm" to "clarify intent"

## 2.3.2 (2026-03-30)

### ops:plan — Prompt consolidation (545 → 473 lines, -13%)

- refactor: removed graphviz diagram from Step 1 (-52 lines) — fully redundant with checklist + prose
- refactor: condensed "Proposing 2-3 approaches" in Step 1 to 2 lines (detail lives in Step 5)
- refactor: condensed "Presenting design by sections" in Step 1 to 2 lines (detail lives in Step 6a)
- refactor: merged duplicate dependency gates in Step 5 into single gate preserving content constraint, workflow sequencing, and consequence language
- refactor: condensed verbose prose in Step 1 — clarity check, clarifying questions, working in codebases
- refactor: removed 3 doubly-enforced emphasis instances (already covered by HARD-GATE tags or consequence language)

## 2.3.1 (2026-03-30)

### ops:plan — No-placeholders rule + TDD granularity

- feat: "No Placeholders" section — explicit list of plan anti-patterns (TBD, "similar to Task N", "add appropriate error handling", etc.)
- feat: TDD granularity rule — tasks should follow micro-cycle (write failing test → run → implement → run → commit) when applicable

### ops:implement — Model selection guidance

- feat: model selection guidance for implementer agents — mechanical tasks use fast models (sonnet/haiku), integration tasks use sonnet, architecture/judgment tasks use the default model
- Reduces cost and increases speed for well-specified tasks

## 2.3.0 (2026-03-30)

### ops:brainstorm — Richer brainstorming process (inspired by superpowers analysis)

- feat: new Step 7 "Propose 2-3 approaches" — present trade-offs and recommendation, wait for user choice before proceeding
- feat: new Step 8 "Present design by sections" — each section validated individually by the user before moving to the next
- feat: task tracking throughout brainstorming — 9 tasks created and tracked for progress visibility
- feat: Step 11 transition — direct offer to launch `/ops:plan`, skipping redundant re-brainstorming
- refactor: workflow expanded from 7 steps to 11

### ops:plan — Brainstorm phase alignment + validation improvements

- feat: Step 1 checklist expanded with "Propose 2-3 approaches" and "Present design by sections"
- feat: Step 1 detects if `/ops:brainstorm` was already run and skips to Step 2 with recap
- feat: Step 6a changed to section-by-section design validation with user approval per section
- feat: Brainstorm Complete gate block now tracks approach chosen and design sections validated
- fix: process flow (graphviz) updated with approach proposal and section validation loops
- fix: LSP diagnostics added to validation gate table in implement skill (Step 2b)
- fix: new Step 0b discovers project test/build commands (Makefile, bin/, package.json) for task validation
- fix: critic REJECT loop requires updating task breakdown to reflect spec changes from review loops

## 2.2.5 (2026-03-30)

### ops:plan — Hardened workflow gates (7 improvements)

- fix: new `HARD-GATE-HANDOFF` at Step 9 — `/ops:plan` NEVER implements code inline; user's "implemente" triggers `/ops:implement` as a separate skill invocation
- fix: critic REJECT now requires structured `## Critic Re-verification` output block before re-dispatch — prevents silent bypass of mandatory re-dispatch
- fix: `HARD-GATE-1` now forbids ALL agent types after Step 0 (was "research agent" only — Explore agents slipped through)
- feat: new Step 0b with mandatory `## Discovered Commands` output — task validation commands must use real project commands, not generic ones
- feat: mandatory `## Brainstorm Complete` exit summary before Step 2 — enforces visual companion evaluation and YAGNI check completion
- fix: Step 6a simplified — removed section-by-section approval requirement (redundant with spec-reviewer loop), keeps design presentation conversational
- fix: Step 9 now presents 3 explicit options (launch implement / review first / implement later) instead of open-ended question

## 2.2.4 (2026-03-24)

### ops:do — Workflow hardening

- fix: Step 1 restatement is now a gate (waits for user approval), with option to escalate to `/ops:brainstorm`
- fix: Step 4 task format requires executable shell validation commands, not prose descriptions
- fix: Step 6 code-quality now explicitly references skill file Steps 1–6 and handles missing tools gracefully (no brute-force retries)
- fix: Step 7 security-gate references `ops-semgrep-scan.sh` and its key=value output format (aligns with v2.2.3 script extraction)
- fix: Step 7 re-dispatch now includes both code-reviewer and security-reviewer when both found issues

## 2.2.3 (2026-03-24)

### Architecture — Script extraction

- feat: new `scripts/ops-semgrep-scan.sh` — encapsulates SAST scanning logic (config detection, diff-aware baseline, JSON parsing, error handling) previously described as LLM prompt prose
- feat: `hooks/session-start` derives `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and adds `scripts/` to PATH for direct script access (scripts prefixed `ops-` to avoid namespace collisions)
- dropped: `scripts/detect-tools.sh` concept — formatter/linter detection delegated to the LLM instead of a finite script; qlty/semgrep binary checks remain in respective skills

### ops:implement — Prose tightening

- chore: tightened implement skill prose (no semantic change)
- fix: `PROJECT_ROOT` in `ops-semgrep-scan.sh` now uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` instead of defaulting to CWD
- fix: file list detection in `ops-semgrep-scan.sh` now includes untracked files via `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`

### ops:code-quality — Simplified tool detection

- refactor: tool detection (Step 1) now relies on LLM examination of project config files instead of a hardcoded tool list

### ops:security-gate — Script-based SAST

- refactor: semgrep invocation delegated to `ops-semgrep-scan.sh`, called directly from PATH
- feat: new `status=findings_unknown` when no JSON parser available — LLM parses raw JSON instead of relying on lossy grep fallback

### ops:setup — JSON parser diagnostic

- feat: Category 3 now detects `jq` / `python3` availability for semgrep result parsing

### Bug fixes (ops-semgrep-scan.sh)

- fix: paths with spaces handled correctly (array-based command construction)
- fix: semgrep stderr captured to temp file for diagnostics instead of being silently suppressed

## 2.2.2 (2026-03-23)

### ops:code-quality — Structural analysis (smells + metrics)

- feat: new Step 4 "Smells" — runs `qlty smells` on modified files to detect duplication, high cyclomatic complexity, and other structural issues
- Distinguishes new vs pre-existing smells: only flags issues introduced by the current work
- feat: new Step 5 "Metrics" — runs `qlty metrics --functions` on modified files, reports only functions exceeding thresholds (cognitive > 15, cyclomatic > 20)
- feat: security findings passthrough — qlty security plugin findings (trivy, trufflehog, osv-scanner, bandit, checkov) are forwarded to `ops:security-gate` instead of being handled in code-quality
- Steps renumbered: Report is now Step 6
- Report output updated with Smells, Metrics, and Security findings lines

### ops:security-gate — Diff-aware SAST + qlty integration

- feat: diff-aware semgrep scanning via `--baseline-commit` — only reports new findings, not pre-existing ones
- feat: baseline detection logic: feature branch → `git merge-base HEAD main`, main branch → `HEAD~1`, fallback documented
- fix: empty semgrep config handling — `.semgrep.yml` with `rules: []` now falls back to `--config auto`
- feat: new Step 1c — incorporates security findings from qlty into triage decision
- Dispatch decision now considers three signal sources: trigger triage + semgrep + qlty

### ops:implement — Traceable validation pipeline

- fix: Task Completion Record (Step 2e) now lists multiple validation commands instead of a single line
- fix: added explicit note linking per-task validation commands to final validation aggregation
- fix: Final validation (Step 5) expanded from one-liner to structured 5-step process: scan → deduplicate → expand scope → execute → report
- feat: Final Validation Checklist template with task attribution per command
- Security triage output now includes SAST and qlty security findings lines

### ops:debug — Aligned review pipeline

- fix: Step 5 restructured to follow the same sequence as ops:implement: Code Quality → Security Gate → Code Review

## 2.2.1 (2026-03-23)

### /ops:setup — Piebald-AI marketplace removal

- fix: removed `Piebald-AI/claude-code-lsps` third-party marketplace and all associated plugins (HTML/CSS, Vue, Scala, PowerShell, Julia, LaTeX, Ada, Solidity)
- Marketplace count reduced from 3 to 2 (`claude-plugins-official` + `boostvolt/claude-code-lsps`)
- Glob file extension list trimmed to match remaining marketplace coverage

### /ops:setup — MCP Servers diagnostic (Category 4)

- feat: new Category 4 "MCP Servers" in `/ops:setup` — checks `context7` and `chrome-devtools-mcp` plugin availability
- Verifies `enabledPlugins` and `extraKnownMarketplaces` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Grouped installation prompt (marketplace + plugin) with A/B/C options
- All "Categories 2-3" references updated to "Categories 2-4" across setup, plan, README

### /ops:debug — Browser Bug Triage (Step 0)

- feat: new Step 0 "Browser Bug Triage" in `/ops:debug` — routes to `chrome-devtools-mcp` skills for browser/frontend bugs

### /ops:plan — Spec no longer auto-committed

- fix: `/ops:plan` no longer commits the spec automatically — the user decides when to commit (via `/ops:ship` or manually)

### Cross-cutting updates

- README.md: updated setup description, requirements (added chrome-devtools-mcp), setup detail table, mermaid diagram

## 2.2.0 (2026-03-23)

### New skill: /ops:setup

- feat: new `/ops:setup` skill — diagnose environment (languages, LSP, code quality tools, security analysis tools) and propose installation for missing tools
- Absorbs `ops:environment-setup` internal phase — all language detection, 4-level LSP diagnostic, marketplace/plugin/binary tables migrated
- Two entry modes: user-invoked (full diagnostic + install proposals) or called by `/ops:plan` Step 0 (Categories 2-3 informational only)
- Detects qlty (unified code quality), semgrep (SAST), and project-specific formatters/linters

### qlty integration in code-quality

- feat: `ops:code-quality` now detects qlty as a priority unified tool — if `qlty` is in PATH and `.qlty/qlty.toml` exists, uses `qlty fmt` and `qlty check` instead of individual formatters/linters
- Two-stage detection: qlty in PATH + `.qlty/qlty.toml` present → use qlty; otherwise → fallback to individual tools
- Crash/timeout resilience: if qlty fails, logs error and continues with fallback
- Report now mentions `/ops:setup` when no tools are detected

### Semgrep integration in security-gate

- feat: new Step 1b in `ops:security-gate` — optional SAST scan with `semgrep scan --config auto --json` on modified files
- Gate-level triage of semgrep findings: LLM evaluates each finding in context of the diff before dispatching — obvious false positives are dismissed without consuming a security-reviewer cycle
- Security Triage output now includes SAST line (findings count / clean / not found / error)
- Crash/timeout/network resilience: if semgrep fails, logs error and continues with LLM triage only

### New file: mise.toml

- feat: `mise.toml` at repo root declares pipx, qlty (`github:qltysh/qlty`), and semgrep (`pipx:semgrep`) as development dependencies for ops contributors

### Cross-cutting updates

- skills/plan/SKILL.md: HARD-GATE-0 updated to reference `ops:setup` instead of prescriptive Glob/ToolSearch/LSP sequence; Step 0a reference changed from `ops:environment-setup` to `ops:setup`
- hooks/session-start: added `/ops:setup` to routing table and routing hints
- README.md: added `/ops:setup` to quick use, workflow diagram, standalone skills table, skills reference; updated code-quality and security-gate descriptions; added qlty and semgrep to requirements; updated structure tree
- .claude-plugin/plugin.json: version bump 2.1.1 → 2.2.0, added setup to description

### Removed

- `ops:environment-setup` internal phase — absorbed into `/ops:setup`

### Stats
- Skills: 17 user-facing + 7 internal phases = 24 total (was 16 + 8 = 24)
- Agents: 11 (unchanged)

## 2.1.1 (2026-03-23)

### Documentation

- docs: workflow and agent dispatch diagrams in README — global workflow diagram, per-skill agent dispatch map (LR layout with agents grouped by role), and individual mermaid diagrams for each skill showing the complete pipeline with agents as hexagonal nodes

### Skill hardening

- fix(implement): add hard gate for validation ownership — orchestrator must run validation commands, not rely on implementer's report
- fix(implement): add hard gate for code-quality ordering — must run before dispatching reviewers
- fix(implement): require structured security triage output (14-trigger checklist) before dispatch decision
- fix(implement): add hard gate for final validation — all commands from all tasks, explicit gap reporting
- fix(implement): strengthen TaskList consistency check — flag anomalies instead of silently proceeding
- fix(plan): require YAGNI assessment block in output before proceeding to research
- fix(plan): add hard gate for research dispatch — enforce exactly 3 typed agents in a single message

## 2.1.0 (2026-03-23)

### New agent: researcher-repo

- feat: new `researcher-repo` agent (Opus) — clones and analyzes external repositories (libraries, frameworks, applications, tools) when documentation and web research are insufficient
- Protocol: locate repo → detect version → shallow clone (version used) → analyze → optionally clone HEAD for comparison → structured report → cleanup
- Version-aware: clones the tag matching the project's dependency version, then optionally compares with HEAD/main
- Mandatory cleanup of cloned directories on completion (success or failure)

### New skill: /ops:clone-analyze

- feat: standalone skill for direct repository analysis — user invokes `/ops:clone-analyze <target>` to analyze an external repo
- 3-step workflow: Clarify → Dispatch researcher-repo → Present findings

### Conditional dispatch in /ops:research

- feat: `researcher-doc` now returns a `Source Verification Needed` list (per target: `high | low | none`) — signals which libraries/tools need source code analysis
- feat: `/ops:research` conditionally dispatches one or more `researcher-repo` agents in parallel for targets with `Needed: high`
- Workflow expanded from 4 steps to 6: Clarify → Parallel Research → Synthesize → Conditional Clone → Final Synthesize → Present

### Security

- fix: `--config core.hooksPath=/dev/null` on all `git clone` commands in researcher-repo — prevents execution of hooks from cloned repositories
- fix: `--config core.fsmonitor=false` on all `git clone` commands — prevents fsmonitor hook execution (CVE-2022-24765 vector)
- feat: post-clone `.gitattributes` filter audit — flags unknown filter drivers in the report

### Robustness

- feat: tag resolution via single `git ls-remote --tags --refs` call instead of 6 sequential clone attempts
- feat: pre-clone size guard via GitHub/GitLab API — abandons clone if repo exceeds 500 MB
- feat: added `pkg/v<version>` to tag resolution order for Go module repos

### Cross-cutting updates

- hooks/session-start: added `/ops:clone-analyze` to routing table
- skills/plan/SKILL.md: updated research delegation to mention parallel multi-target researcher-repo dispatch
- README.md: added researcher-repo agent, clone-analyze skill, updated counts (11 agents, 16 skills), added clone-analyze to Mermaid diagram
- agents/researcher-doc.md: documented that `Source Verification Needed` is consumed by `/ops:research` only

### Stats
- Agents: 10 → 11 (+researcher-repo)
- Skills: 15 → 16 user-facing (+clone-analyze)

## 2.0.1 (2026-03-21)

### Fixes from session 615af0fa analysis

#### Parallel dispatch enforcement (11 skills)
- fix: explicit "single message, multiple Agent tool_use blocks" rule in `ops:subagent-rules` — models were dispatching agents in separate messages (sequential) despite "in parallel" instructions
- fix: inline reminders at every parallel dispatch site (research, implement, do, test, perf, refactor, circuit-breaker, review-pr, debug)
- fix: `ops:subagent-rules` heading and description updated to reflect new parallelism scope

#### Spec commit sequencing (plan)
- fix: move spec git commit from Step 6b (before review) to Step 6d (after review loop) — previously, the committed version was stale if the spec-reviewer found issues
- fix: explicit `git add && git commit` instruction with guard: "Do NOT say committed unless git commit succeeded"

#### Visual Companion gate (plan)
- fix: add visual companion check to brainstorm gate — model must evaluate whether the topic involves visual questions before proceeding to context detection

#### Security transparency in spec review (plan)
- fix: security-related issues found by spec-reviewer must be presented to user before fixing — security decisions should be transparent, not silently resolved

#### Cross-reference and numbering fixes
- fix: `debug/SKILL.md` cross-reference corrected from `/ops:implement Step 2d` (Discovery Check) to `Step 4` (Final Review)
- fix: `implement/SKILL.md` Step 5 final validation marked MANDATORY with justification
- fix: `implement/SKILL.md` Step 5 duplicate numbering (two `3.`) corrected to sequential 1-2-3-4-5

## 2.0.0 (2026-03-20)

### Composable phases architecture

Extracted ~400 lines of duplicated content from 8 skills into 8 reusable internal phases. Skills now reference phases instead of inlining shared content.

#### New internal phases (`user-invocable: false`)
- `ops:instruction-priority` — instruction hierarchy (user > CLAUDE.md > ops skill > system prompt)
- `ops:subagent-rules` — context rules for dispatching subagents
- `ops:environment-setup` — language/framework detection + 4-level LSP diagnostic (test, marketplace, plugin, binary)
- `ops:code-quality` — format + lint modified files before code review
- `ops:discovery-checks` — Minor/Significant/Major discovery categorization
- `ops:circuit-breaker` — repeated failure diagnostic (researcher-code + git-historian)
- `ops:security-gate` — triage (14 triggers) + dispatch security-reviewer + re-verification loop (cap 3)
- `ops:redispatch-optimization` — generic re-dispatch prompt optimization pattern

#### New skills
- `/ops:research` — autonomous exploration: dispatches researcher-code + researcher-doc + git-historian in parallel
- `/ops:brainstorm` — interactive Socratic brainstorming extracted from /ops:plan Step 1
- `/ops:full` — meta-pipeline: chains /ops:plan → user approval → /ops:implement → /ops:ship
- `/ops:test` — add tests to existing untested code (dispatches test-writer agent)
- `/ops:refactor` — restructure code without changing behavior (coverage gate → incremental steps → verify)
- `/ops:perf` — performance investigation and optimization (baseline → profile → optimize → measure)
- `/ops:review-pr` — review external PRs (dispatches pr-reviewer agent + security-gate)

#### New agents
- `test-writer` — analyzes existing code and writes meaningful tests (behavior, not implementation)
- `pr-reviewer` — reviews external PRs with structured actionable comments

#### Refactored skills
- `/ops:plan` — removed inline instruction-priority, subagent-rules, environment-setup, lsp-setup, redispatch-optimization
- `/ops:implement` — removed inline instruction-priority, subagent-rules, discovery-checks, circuit-breaker, security-triage, security-redispatch, redispatch-optimization
- `/ops:do` — removed inline instruction-priority, subagent-rules, environment-setup, lsp-setup
- `/ops:debug` — removed inline instruction-priority, subagent-rules, discovery-checks, circuit-breaker
- `/ops:security` — removed inline instruction-priority, security-triage, security-redispatch
- `/ops:verify` — removed inline instruction-priority
- `/ops:review` — removed inline instruction-priority
- `/ops:ship` — removed inline instruction-priority

#### Harmonization
- Ansible detection added to `ops:environment-setup` (previously only in `/ops:plan` inline)
- Ansible LSP entry added to boostvolt marketplace table in `ops:environment-setup`
- Instruction-priority extracted into `ops:instruction-priority` phase and referenced from all 11 user-facing skills

#### Hook updated
- SessionStart routing table expanded: 15 entries (was 8) — added research, brainstorm, full, test, refactor, perf, review-pr

#### Stats
- Skills: 8 → 15 user-facing + 8 internal phases = 23 total
- Agents: 8 → 10 (+test-writer, +pr-reviewer)

## 1.6.1 (2026-03-20)

- feat: add Ansible LSP support (ansible-language-server via boostvolt/claude-code-lsps)
- feat: add Ansible-specific detection in Step 0a (ansible.cfg, galaxy.yml, roles/, playbooks/ markers)

## 1.6.0 (2026-03-19)

- feat: add `/ops:do` skill — lightweight structured workflow (research, execute, verify, review) for well-understood tasks

## 1.5.2 (2026-03-19)

- feat: optimize review agent re-dispatch prompts — re-dispatches now include previous findings + corrections instead of full context
- feat: standardize circuit breaker caps to 3 iterations — spec-reviewer stays at 3, critic 2→3, security-reviewer loops capped at 3
- feat: add re-dispatch loop for security-reviewer in implement and security skills (previously single conditional re-dispatch)

## 1.5.1 (2026-03-19)

- feat: add Terraform, Clojure, Dart, Elixir, Gleam, Nix, OCaml, Ruby, Zig LSP support (boostvolt/claude-code-lsps)
- feat: add Piebald-AI/claude-code-lsps as third marketplace (community) for HTML/CSS, Vue, Scala, PowerShell, Julia, LaTeX, Ada, Solidity
- fix: clarify HARD-GATE-0 wording — "do not ask design questions" instead of "do not talk to user"

## 1.5.0 (2026-03-18)

- feat: move language detection and LSP diagnostic to Step 0 (runs before brainstorming to catch restart-requiring issues early)

## 1.4.2 (2026-03-17)

- docs: fix install instructions — separate marketplace and local clone methods, remove incorrect commands

## 1.4.1 (2026-03-17)

### Fixes from session d6e7934d analysis
- fix: require risk profile (maintenance status, last release, community size) for dependencies validated conversationally during brainstorming, not just at the formal Step 5 gate
- fix: remove `--all` flag from git-historian search commands — prevents finding commits from unmerged branches, stashes, or orphaned refs that are not on the current branch lineage

## 1.4.0 (2026-03-16)

- docs: add tip about git cloning external sources for deeper understanding
- docs: add marketplace prerequisite to install instructions

## 1.3.0 (2026-03-16)

### Move code review and security review to final-only

Per-task code review and security review removed. Both now happen once at the end on the complete diff.

**Why**: Real-world cost analysis showed per-task reviews would cost ~$37 (15 code-reviewers + 10 security-reviewers) while adding no detection value — the final review catches the same bugs with better cross-task context. Two sessions confirmed: 5 bugs found in final review (session 659f), 0 bugs caught by per-task reviews that the final review missed (session 7ea1).

#### Per-task pipeline simplified
- Pipeline is now: `implementer → validation → conformity check → discovery check → task completion record`
- No code-reviewer or security-reviewer dispatched per task
- Conformity check (orchestrator-level, no agent dispatch) remains as the per-task quality gate
- Task completion record simplified: removed code review and security triage lines

#### Final review restructured
- Security triage now happens once on the complete diff with explicit output format
- Code-reviewer and security-reviewer dispatched in parallel on the full diff
- Pre-review audit simplified to count implementers vs tasks (no per-task review counts)

#### Cost impact
- Estimated review cost per session: ~$3-4 (1 final code review + 1 final security review) instead of ~$37 (15+10 per-task dispatches)

## 1.2.0 (2026-03-16)

### Orchestrator compliance enforcement — anti-skip mechanisms

Based on real-world session analysis where the orchestrator skipped code reviews (2/15 tasks reviewed), never dispatched the security-reviewer (despite network policies, access control, and identity federation), and bundled multiple tasks into single implementer agents.

#### External Dependency Validation gate (plan)
- New MANDATORY gate in Step 5: all agent-chosen dependencies must be presented to the user with alternatives before inclusion in the spec
- Distinguishes user-requested dependencies (already validated) from agent-chosen dependencies (must ask)
- Prevents the agent from silently choosing libraries, charts, tools, or services without user approval

#### Task Completion Record (implement)
- New Step 2f: mandatory structured output for every task with explicit security triage line
- Forces the orchestrator to write "Security triage: YES/NO" after evaluating the 14 triggers — no silent skipping
- Covers all pipeline steps: implementer status, validation command + exit code, conformity, code review, security triage, discovery

#### Pre-review Audit (implement)
- New mandatory audit before final review: counts implementers dispatched, code reviews completed, security reviews dispatched
- Detects discrepancies (bundled tasks, skipped reviews, missing security dispatches) and blocks final review until fixed

#### Anti-bundling post-hoc verification (implement)
- HARD-GATE now includes post-hoc count check: implementer agents dispatched must equal tasks in plan
- If fewer implementers were dispatched than tasks exist, the orchestrator must re-run the bundled tasks individually

## 1.1.1 (2026-03-16)

### Remove technology-specific examples
- Replaced all Kubernetes/infra-specific examples (Kustomize, Helm, ArgoCD, Cilium, ConfigMap, ServiceMonitor, cert-manager) with technology-agnostic equivalents across all skills and agents
- Examples now use generic patterns (Express, PostgreSQL, React, auth middleware, API routes) that apply to any stack
- Affected files: ship/SKILL.md, plan/SKILL.md, implement/SKILL.md, researcher-doc.md, spec-reviewer.md, COMPARISON-vs-SUPERPOWERS.md

## 1.1.0 (2026-03-16)

### New skill: `/ops:security`
- On-demand security review — invoke directly without going through `/ops:implement` or `/ops:debug`
- Supports multiple scopes: staged changes, specific files, directories, branch diff, specific commit
- Triages security domains before dispatching, skips review when nothing sensitive is found
- Optional fix-and-verify loop: apply fixes, re-dispatch security-reviewer to confirm

### Security reviewer rewritten — fully technology-agnostic
- Covers the full spectrum: application code, infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, container/runtime, supply chain, policy enforcement
- 9 analysis categories (was 5): added CI/CD & Build Pipeline, Supply Chain & Dependencies, Policy Enforcement & Compliance, expanded Infrastructure & Runtime
- Broader trust boundaries: `build → deploy`, `human → machine` in addition to classic user/service boundaries
- Broader attacker profiles: CI/CD attacker, supply chain attacker, insider
- No technology names anywhere — principles over vendors
- Explicit constraint: "Technology-agnostic. Name the principle, not the vendor."

### Security escalation triggers expanded (implement, debug)
- 8 triggers → 14 triggers covering full DevSecOps spectrum
- Added: IaC, CI/CD pipelines, runtime privileges, dependency/supply chain, policy enforcement, data storage/retention, logging/audit/observability
- Removed technology-specific references (OIDC, OAuth2, Kyverno, OPA) — replaced with agnostic equivalents

### SessionStart hook updated
- Added `/ops:security` to skill routing table

## 1.0.1 (2026-03-16)

Enforcement fixes based on real-world session analysis. Addresses orchestrator compliance gaps where steps were skipped or shortcuts taken.

### Enforce per-task code review (`implement/SKILL.md`)
- Add HARD-GATE: every task must complete full pipeline (implementer → validation → conformity → code review) before next task starts
- One task = one implementer agent — no bundling multiple tasks into a single dispatch
- Parallelization rules: max 3 parallel tasks, each with its own complete pipeline
- Code review made MANDATORY with strict trivial-task exception (≤1 file, pure rename/comment/config, no logic)
- Conformity check (2c) made MANDATORY with explicit diff-vs-plan verification

### Enforce security-reviewer dispatch (`implement/SKILL.md`, `debug/SKILL.md`)
- Security escalation is now a gate, not a suggestion — "you have FAILED this skill" if skipped
- Added OIDC/SSO/OAuth2 and Kyverno/OPA to security-sensitive areas list
- Final review: security-reviewer mandatory when any task touched security areas
- "When in doubt, dispatch" — false positives are cheap, missed vulns are not

### Enforce critic and spec-reviewer re-dispatch (`plan/SKILL.md`)
- Critic re-dispatch after REJECT is now MANDATORY — "you have FAILED this skill" if skipped
- Spec-reviewer re-dispatch after fixes is now MANDATORY

### Enforce context detection and research adequacy (`plan/SKILL.md`)
- Context detection (Step 2) cannot be skipped — "Do NOT skip this step"
- LSP Level 1 test is now mandatory (takes seconds)
- Research adequacy check must present an explicit OK/GAP table to the user

### Enforce brainstorm discipline (`plan/SKILL.md`)
- "One question at a time" reinforced: ONE question per message, not 2-3 grouped
- Anti-pattern: "If you catch yourself writing Question 4:, Question 5: — STOP"
- Explicit user approval question added at Step 9

### Enforce TaskList verification (`implement/SKILL.md`)
- TaskList call at completion is now MANDATORY — must be called and shown

### Remove hardcoded model references (all SKILL.md files)
- Removed all `(Sonnet)` and `(Opus)` model annotations from skill files
- Model is defined in agent frontmatter, not in the skill — avoids inconsistency

### Agents upgraded to Opus
- **spec-reviewer** — Sonnet → Opus
- **implementer** — Sonnet → Opus
- **code-reviewer** — Sonnet → Opus
- **security-reviewer** — Sonnet → Opus

### Align debug/SKILL.md
- Same security escalation enforcement as implement
- Same trivial-task exception for code review
- Removed model references
